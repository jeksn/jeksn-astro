The framework behind this site is [Astro](https://astro.build/), which is a fantastic tool for building simple content focused sites.

I'm not using a CMS right now since I'm the only one doing anything on the site and adding one would just be unnecessary work.

Most of the pages are using .astro, .md, and .mdx files and right now /notes is using the [Content Collection](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) feature in Astro.

I'm planning to build out some more functionality with it, maybe a blog, but we'll see.

The CSS is all [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [AlpineJS](https://alpinejs.dev) is used in some places for interactions.

It's hosted on Vercel, but this might change since I'm not a huge fan of where they're going at the moment. So might migrate the site to Cloudflare when I have the time.
